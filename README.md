# About Me

I like developing cool stuff using Roblox and Web Technologies.

I am fluent in TypeScript (typed JavaScript), Luau (derived from Lua), and Python. My favourite language is TypeScript as I can see a lot of potential with it.

# My Projects

## Flow Browser (Owner & Maintainer)

Time Period: March 2025 - Present

[Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) was being abandoned at the time and there is no good alternatives. [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/) is one, but it is built with Firefox which is not preferred by people. So I started building this browser, hoping to make it good enough so I can switch over.

## Toilet Tower Defense (Lead Developer)

Time Period: July 2023 - Present

This Roblox game is based on the popular [Skibidi Toilet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skibidi_Toilet) meme at the time. It reached 5 billion visits and peaked around 400,000 players at the time.

# My Small Side Projects

## GameMatcher

Since Roblox Services are not enough for efficient matchmaking, I created this with Bun, Hono and MongoDB to handle matchmaking on Roblox. This can also be used for other platforms, but it is mainly built to support matchmaking in Roblox Games. I made this to be easily configurable so people who aren't fluent in JavaScript can still use it efficiently.

This is currently used by Toilet Tower Defense for Ranked Matchmaking.

## osa-bridge (npm)

I developed this for [Flow Browser](https://flow-browser.com/). It is used support AppleScript on Electron Apps which can help it intergrate to the native macOS environment.
